# Example Resource Driver for Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)

This repository contains an example resource driver for use with the [Dynamic
Resource Allocation
(DRA)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/)
feature of Kubernetes.

It is intended to demonstrate best-practices for how to construct a DRA
resource driver and wrap it in a [helm chart](https://helm.sh/). It can be used
as a starting point for implementing a driver for your own set of resources.

## Quickstart and Demo

Before diving into the details of how this example driver is constructed, it's
useful to run through a quick demo of it in action.

The driver itself provides access to a set of mock GPU devices, and this demo
walks through the process of building and installing the driver followed by
running a set of workloads that consume these GPUs.

The procedure below has been tested and verified on both Linux and Mac.

### Prerequisites

* [GNU Make 3.81+](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [GNU Tar 1.34+](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)
* [docker v20.10+ (including buildx)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Podman v4.9+](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
* [kind v0.17.0+](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
* [helm v3.7.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* [kubectl v1.18+](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)

### Demo
We start by first cloning this repository and `cd`ing into it. All of the
scripts and example Pod specs used in this demo are contained here, so take a
moment to browse through the various files and see what's available:
```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver.git
cd dra-example-driver
```

**Note**: The scripts will automatically use either `docker`, or `podman` as the container tool command, whichever
can be found in the PATH. To override this behavior, set `CONTAINER_TOOL` environment variable either by calling
`export CONTAINER_TOOL=docker`, or by prepending `CONTAINER_TOOL=docker` to a script
(e.g. `CONTAINER_TOOL=docker ./path/to/script.sh`). Keep in mind that building Kind images currently requires Docker.

From here we will build the image for the example resource driver:
```bash
./demo/build-driver.sh
```

And create a `kind` cluster to run it in:
```bash
./demo/create-cluster.sh
```

Once the cluster has been created successfully, double check everything is
coming up as expected:
```console
$ kubectl get pod -A

```

The validating admission webhook is disabled by default. To enable it, install cert-manager and its CRDs, then
set the `webhook.enabled=true` value when the dra-example-driver chart is installed.
```bash
helm install \
  --repo https://charts.jetstack.io \
  --version v1.16.3 \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --wait \
  --set crds.enabled=true \
  cert-manager \
  cert-manager
```
More options for installing cert-manager can be found in [their docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/)

And then install the example resource driver via `helm`.
```bash
helm upgrade -i \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace dra-example-driver \
  dra-example-driver \
  deployments/helm/dra-example-driver
```

Double check the driver components have come up successfully:
```console
$ kubectl get pod -n dra-example-driver
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dra-example-driver-kubeletplugin-qwmbl                1/1     Running   0          1m
dra-example-driver-webhook-7d465fbd5b-n2wxt           1/1     Running   0          1m
```

And show the initial state of available GPU devices on the worker node:
```
$ kubectl get resourceslice -o yaml

Next, deploy four example apps that demonstrate how `ResourceClaim`s,
`ResourceClaimTemplate`s, and custom `GpuConfig` objects can be used to
select and configure resources in various ways:
```bash
kubectl apply --filename=demo/gpu-test{1,2,3,4,5}.yaml
```

And verify that they are coming up successfully:
```console
$ kubectl get pod -A
NAMESPACE   NAME   READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
...
gpu-test1   pod0   0/1     Pending             0          2s
gpu-test1   pod1   0/1     Pending             0          2s
gpu-test2   pod0   0/2     Pending             0          2s
gpu-test3   pod0   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          2s
gpu-test3   pod1   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          2s
gpu-test4   pod0   0/1     Pending             0          2s
gpu-test5   pod0   0/4     Pending             0          2s
...
```

Use your favorite editor to look through each of the `gpu-test{1,2,3,4,5}.yaml`
files and see what they are doing. The semantics of each match the figure
below:

![Demo Apps Figure](demo/demo-apps.png?raw=true "Semantics of the applications requesting resources from the example DRA resource driver.")

Then dump the logs of each app to verify that GPUs were allocated to them
according to these semantics:
```bash
for example in $(seq 1 5); do \
  echo "gpu-test${example}:"
  for pod in $(kubectl get pod -n gpu-test${example} --output=jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do \
    for ctr in $(kubectl get pod -n gpu-test${example} ${pod} -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}'); do \
      echo "${pod} ${ctr}:"
      if [ "${example}" -lt 3 ]; then
        kubectl logs -n gpu-test${example} ${pod} -c ${ctr}| grep -E "GPU_DEVICE_[0-9]+=" | grep -v "RESOURCE_CLAIM"
      else
        kubectl logs -n gpu-test${example} ${pod} -c ${ctr}| grep -E "GPU_DEVICE_[0-9]+" | grep -v "RESOURCE_CLAIM"
      fi
    done
  done
  echo ""
done
```

This should produce output similar to the following:
```bash
gpu-test1:
pod0 ctr0:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_6="gpu-6"
pod1 ctr0:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_7="gpu-7"

gpu-test2:
pod0 ctr0:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_0="gpu-0"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_1="gpu-1"

gpu-test3:
pod0 ctr0:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_2="gpu-2"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_2_SHARING_STRATEGY="TimeSlicing"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_2_TIMESLICE_INTERVAL="Default"
pod0 ctr1:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_2="gpu-2"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_2_SHARING_STRATEGY="TimeSlicing"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_2_TIMESLICE_INTERVAL="Default"

gpu-test4:
pod0 ctr0:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_3="gpu-3"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_3_SHARING_STRATEGY="TimeSlicing"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_3_TIMESLICE_INTERVAL="Default"
pod1 ctr0:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_3="gpu-3"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_3_SHARING_STRATEGY="TimeSlicing"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_3_TIMESLICE_INTERVAL="Default"

gpu-test5:
pod0 ts-ctr0:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_4="gpu-4"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_4_SHARING_STRATEGY="TimeSlicing"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_4_TIMESLICE_INTERVAL="Long"
pod0 ts-ctr1:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_4="gpu-4"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_4_SHARING_STRATEGY="TimeSlicing"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_4_TIMESLICE_INTERVAL="Long"
pod0 sp-ctr0:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_5="gpu-5"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_5_PARTITION_COUNT="10"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_5_SHARING_STRATEGY="SpacePartitioning"
pod0 sp-ctr1:
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_5="gpu-5"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_5_PARTITION_COUNT="10"
declare -x GPU_DEVICE_5_SHARING_STRATEGY="SpacePartitioning"
```

In this example resource driver, no "actual" GPUs are made available to any
containers. Instead, a set of environment variables are set in each container
to indicate which GPUs *would* have been injected into them by a real resource
driver and how they *would* have been configured.

You can use the IDs of the GPUs as well as the GPU sharing settings set in
these environment variables to verify that they were handed out in a way
consistent with the semantics shown in the figure above.

Once you have verified everything is running correctly, delete all of the
example apps:
```bash
kubectl delete --wait=false --filename=demo/gpu-test{1,2,3,4,5}.yaml
```

And wait for them to terminate:
```console
$ kubectl get pod -A
NAMESPACE   NAME   READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
...
gpu-test1   pod0   1/1     Terminating   0          31m
gpu-test1   pod1   1/1     Terminating   0          31m
gpu-test2   pod0   2/2     Terminating   0          31m
gpu-test3   pod0   1/1     Terminating   0          31m
gpu-test3   pod1   1/1     Terminating   0          31m
gpu-test4   pod0   1/1     Terminating   0          31m
gpu-test5   pod0   4/4     Terminating   0          31m
...
```

Finally, you can run the following to cleanup your environment and delete the
`kind` cluster started previously:
```bash
./demo/delete-cluster.sh
```

## Installing the example driver on a GKE cluster
It is also possible to run the example driver on a GKE cluster. For this, we
will use the pre-built image for the kubelet plugin, so there is no need
to build anything. All that is needed is a Google Cloud Platform account,
the gcloud CLI and Helm.

To keep things simple and identical to the Kind example, we will use a
single-node GKE cluster.

CDI must be enabled in containerd for the DRA driver to work. CDI is
enabled by default in GKE since 1.32.1-gke.1489001, so we will create
a cluster in the rapid channel to make sure we get a recent version.

Since DRA is still a beta feature, we need to explicitely enable it
when the cluster is created.

First, create a GKE cluster with gcloud.
```bash
gcloud container clusters create dra-example-driver-cluster \
--location=us-central1-c \
--release-channel=rapid \
--num-nodes=1 \
--enable-kubernetes-unstable-apis=resource.k8s.io/v1beta1/deviceclasses,resource.k8s.io/v1beta1/resourceclaims,resource.k8s.io/v1beta1/resourceclaimtemplates,resource.k8s.io/v1beta1/resourceslices
```

Once the cluster is ready, we can install the DRA using Helm.

The kubelet plugin in the example driver is set up to run with priority class
`system-node-critical`. On GKE, pods are by default restricted from running
with this priority class, so we need to use a ResourceQuota to allow it. The
Helm chart supports, this, we just have to enable it.

```bash
helm upgrade -i \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace dra-example-driver \
  --set=resourcequota.enabled=true \
  dra-example-driver \
  deployments/helm/dra-example-driver
```

The examples in `demo/gpu-test{1,2,3,4,5}.yaml` works just like with Kind.
